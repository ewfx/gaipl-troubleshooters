echo "$timestamp: Stopping mortgagelending services..."

# Scale down deployments to zero replicas.  Replace 'mortgagelending-deployment' with 
# the actual deployment name(s) for your application.  You might need multiple commands 
# if you have multiple deployments.
kubectl scale deployment mortgagelending-deployment --replicas=0

# Wait for the pods to terminate.  Adjust timeout as needed.
kubectl wait --for=condition=terminated deployment/mortgagelending-deployment --timeout=60s


# --- 2. Apply necessary fixes ---

echo "$timestamp: Applying fixes..."

# Option 1: Increase resource requests and limits for the affected deployments.
# This assumes you have identified the appropriate resource requirements.  Replace
# with your actual values. This example increases both CPU and memory.
kubectl patch deployment mortgagelending-deployment -p '{"spec": {"template": {"spec": {"containers": [{"name": "mortgagelending-container", "resources": {"requests": {"cpu": "200m", "memory": "512Mi"}, "limits": {"cpu": "500m", "memory": "1Gi"}}}]}}}}'

# Option 2:  If resource limits are already high, check for resource leaks or optimize
# application code for resource usage.  This requires application-specific debugging,
# and this script cannot automatically perform these actions.  Instead, add logging here
# to indicate that manual intervention is required.
# echo "$timestamp: Potential resource leak detected. Manual intervention required." >> /var/log/mortgagelending_remediation.log

# Option 3: Add more nodes to the Kubernetes cluster. This is a longer-term solution if
# the cluster is consistently resource-constrained. This requires cluster-admin privileges.
# kubectl scale nodepool <node-pool-name> --replicas=<desired-number-of-replicas>
